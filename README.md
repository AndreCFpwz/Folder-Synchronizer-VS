The script should work only in Linux distros and in Windows.
To run this script you must have Python 3 installed.
You can run it using command lines by typing "python" + the path to this file.
Use the source file's path and the replica file's path as arguments to dictate which are the files you want to copy.
This script only works while it is running on terminal, if you kill the terminal it will stop synchronizing.

The Folder Synchronizer was created to copy the source folder/directory of you choice to a replica (also of your choice) folder. Anything you add or delete from the source folder should also be added or deleted from the replica folder.
